# lazy_rebalance
 
This is a python reimplementation of the "Optimal lazy portfolio rebalancing calculator"
on http://optimalrebalancing.tk/index.html.

# What it does

From the original website:

> When contributing, use this calculator to help you purchase under-weighted
> assets optimally using only the contributed amount so that you get as close
> as possible to your target allocation without selling anything. Similarly,
> if you are withdrawing from your portfolio, use this calculator to help you
> sell over-weighted assets optimally to yield the desired withdrawal while
> getting as close as possible to your target allocation without purchasing
> anything.

# Why python?

The source code for that calculator is licensed under the GPL but it is only
provided in minified-JavaScript form, which was pretty hard for me to understand.

Rewriting it in python was how I understood what it is actually doing.
